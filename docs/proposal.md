## Summary of the Project

The idea of our project is solving some simple smart mazes, which Navigator and some smart tools collecting AI will be involved. The input will be a complete maze, and the output will be the character reaching the destination in small amount of time. During this process, the character will be collecting some tools in order to help him go through some parts of the maze. Moreover, the smart navigator will guide him to where he supposes to be.

## AI/ML Algorithms

We will be using some graph algorithms like, Dijktra's Algorithm, Prim-Dijktra-Jarnik Algorithm, and dynamic programming for finding the minimum spanning tree.

## Evaluation Plan

We will work really hard (Finish this part)

## Appointment with the Instructor

Our meeting time is: 03:30pm - Thursday, April 27, 2017  
The meeting place is: DBH 4204
