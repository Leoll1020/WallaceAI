## Summary of the Project

The idea of our project is creating and solving some simple smart mazes, which Navigator and some smart tools collecting AI will be involved. The input will be playerâ€™s command. The character will follow commands to complete task and explore a complete maze, and the output will be the character reaching the destination in small amount of time. During this process, the character will be collecting some tools in order to help him arrive the destination. Moreover, the smart navigator will guide him to where he supposes to be. For example, the character will learn the best way from home to everywhere.

## AI/ML Algorithms

We will be using some graph algorithms like, Dijktra's Algorithm, Prim-Dijktra-Jarnik Algorithm, and dynamic programming for finding the minimum spanning tree. For the ML alogrithm, nerual network, random froest, decision tree will be applied.

## Evaluation Plan

Numeric metrics: We will calculate the ROC curve and AUC value. The AUC value becomes larger means the performance of our data becomes better. We should check the accuracy of our algorithm by using plenty of test sets. 

Baselines: Our algorithm should find the destination correctly and generate the shortest path quickly.
