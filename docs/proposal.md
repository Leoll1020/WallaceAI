## Summary of the Project

The idea of our project is creating and solving some simple smart mazes, which Navigator and some smart tools collecting AI will be involved. The input will be playerâ€™s command. The character will explore a complete maze, and the output will be the character reaching the destination in small amount of time. During this process, the character will be collecting some tools in order to help him go through some parts of the maze. Moreover, the smart navigator will guide him to where he supposes to be. For example, the character will choose the best way from home to everywhere.

## AI/ML Algorithms

We will be using some graph algorithms like, Dijktra's Algorithm, Prim-Dijktra-Jarnik Algorithm, and dynamic programming for finding the minimum spanning tree. For the ML alogrithm, nerual network, random froest, decision tree will be applied.

## Evaluation Plan

The baseline of the evaluation of the project will be whether the person is able to reach the destination or not.

In another paragraph, describe what qualitative analysis you will show to verify the project works
