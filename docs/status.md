## Project Summary
After the cafully thinking, we improved our maze to a prinson brek game. We designed several rooms in the map and different rooms have different tasks. The agent should learn how to pick up stuffs, how to synthesis tools and how to escape from the prison. We will set up some zombies and traps in the room. And we will put some tools such that redstones, sticks, food, money and ladder as well. The agent should pick up these tools to escape. For the first version of our Prison Break game, we tried to set up 9 rooms. The agent learn pick up tools and used existing tools open the doors and faces different situations. There are traps, zombies, tools and exit behind the door.
